    "# Feature Store Query Planner Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The query planner in the Hopsworks Feature Store allows to query the feature store with high level functions, such as `get_features`, and `get_featuregroup`. However, it is only intended as a utility tool, and the user can always fall back to using pure SQL to query the feature store.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will go over a common \"gotcha\" when using the featurestore query planner: **naming conflicts**. A feature name is only guaranteed to be unique within its feature group and version. The feature name **is not globally unique**; this means that conflicts can occur. In this notebook we will illustrate how to handle querying the feature store when there are conflicts.\n",

    "TLDR;\n",

    "If there is a conflict, you can fall back to using pure SQL to query the feature store, or you can provide extra information to the query planner in order to resolve the conflict."
